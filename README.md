# Typehero 
A school project 

It is deployed through Github Pages and can be accessed here: [Typehero](https://oxelf.github.io/typehero/)

### Features
- Typing speed test
- See a timeline of your wpm and when you did mistakes
- different modes, such as words/quotes and how much words
- customizable theme of the website
- data is stored in local storage



It is responsive, but there is currently no input handling for mobile.

No dependencies where used in this project.
I got the words and quotes from this [repo](https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/blob/master/frontend/static/quotes/german.json)
The icons are from the [heroicons library](https://heroicons.com).

The js code might be a bit messy, but if it works, it works.
